						<p class='description'>
								Over the last few years, low-cost commodity sensors have hit the markets allowing — for the first time — the ability to measure hyperlocal air quality conditions, both inside and outside of our homes. At the University of Utah, we are building infrastructure that utilizes these new sensors to create accurate measurements of air quality microclimates. We have three synergistic projects:
								<br /><br />
								<strong><span class="projectDescription">Outdoor Air Quality</span> leverages existing government and community-based air quality efforts to build a dense network of sensors across Salt Lake City; <br /><br />
								<span class="projectDescription">AirU</span> engages kids in Salt Lake schools through learning about air quality with a Lego Maker kit and hosting of commodity sensors in classrooms;
								<br /><br />
								<span class="projectDescription">Indoor Air Quality</span> uses a network of sensors in the homes of asthmatic families to better understand indoor air quality.</strong>
								<br /><br />

								Each of these projects utilizes our research in sensor design, air quality science, computational modeling, and communication of data; furthermore, they rely on citizens to engage, promote, and facilitate science.

								We are currently looking for Salt Lake City residents to be part of building our outdoor network by hosting sensors at their homes. Want to get involved? See our sign-up below.

								<br /><br />

								This work is generously funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health.
